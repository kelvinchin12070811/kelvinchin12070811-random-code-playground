# LRU Cache

LRU Cache (Least Recently Used Cache) is a type of caching system that uses an algorithm to track and manage the cache.
It works by tracking the items that are accessed most recently and removing the least recently used items from the cache
when the cache reaches its capacity. The LRU Cache is used to increase the performance of a system by storing frequently
used data in a fast and easy to access location. It is a popular caching system due to its efficient use of memory and
its ability to quickly retrieve data.
